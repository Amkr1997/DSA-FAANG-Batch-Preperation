4. Question :- An almost sorted array is given to us and the task is to sort that array completely. Then,
               which sorting algorithm would you prefer and why?
   
   Answer =>   From my learning right now I can think of insertion sort. 
               It would be much better suited for almost sorted array,
               Because this method makes the least number of comparisons. 
               Here array gets divide into 2 parts while solving left part for sorted and right for unsorted, 
               Very few elements are left out here and Insertion sort is good for less elements in array. 
               So that's why I think for sorting larger array we can use other algos but in this case Insertion would be good.
